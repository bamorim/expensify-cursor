## Description

This task builds the core policy resolution engine that determines which policy applies to a specific user/category combination and applies the appropriate rules. The engine must handle policy precedence, calculate limits based on time periods, and provide debugging tools for transparency. This is the heart of the expense management system that enables automatic processing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System correctly determines applicable policy for user/category combinations
- [ ] Policy precedence rules are properly enforced (user-specific > organization-wide)
- [ ] Time-based limits are calculated correctly (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- [ ] Policy application results in correct auto-approval/rejection decisions
- [ ] Policy debugging tools provide clear visibility into decision-making
- [ ] Engine handles edge cases gracefully (no policy, multiple policies, expired policies)
- [ ] Performance is optimized for real-time policy resolution
- [ ] All policy decisions are logged for audit purposes

## TODOs

- [ ] Implement policy matching logic for user/category combinations
  - [ ] Create policy resolution service
  - [ ] Implement precedence-based policy selection
  - [ ] Handle cases with no applicable policy
  - [ ] Add policy expiration checking
- [ ] Create policy application service
  - [ ] Implement limit calculation based on time periods
  - [ ] Add expense amount validation against limits
  - [ ] Create auto-approval/rejection logic
  - [ ] Handle policy rule evaluation
- [ ] Implement auto-approval/rejection logic
  - [ ] Create approval decision service
  - [ ] Implement rejection with reason codes
  - [ ] Add manual review routing for edge cases
  - [ ] Create approval workflow state management
- [ ] Add policy debugging and transparency features
  - [ ] Create policy application preview
  - [ ] Add decision explanation and reasoning
  - [ ] Implement policy audit logging
  - [ ] Create debugging dashboard for admins
